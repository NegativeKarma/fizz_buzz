# Fizz_Buzz Project

## Project for Ruby, week 3 pre-course at Craftacademy


**Introduction to the project**

* The task was to reproduce the Fizz Buzz game using Ruby.
  The purpose was to practice Ruby both by following instructions
  and adding some methods for the "sad path" possibilities, even
  more important was to set RSpec to test the code.


**Gems used**

* The Gem used was "rspec" taken from https://rubygems.org


**How to use the application**

* The application can be used by accessing Terminal and entering irb.
  Open 'fizz_buzz.rb' from the lib folder, create a new array,
  then write : `100.times {|n| output << fizz_buzz(n+1)}` and run the array.
